<p>Work continues.</br></br> Did some research at lunch today as I don’t have any experience specifically with opengles. Turns out gles 2 is very fully featured. Good news for what I need to do. I also found a nice SDL2 sample that I should test on the xbox. According to the Emscripten SDL2 readme and the laws of UWP I expect that to be fine. </br>Just stubbing out some audio functions this evening as it’ll be easier to rewrite that project with the function stubs already in place.</p>
